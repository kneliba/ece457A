The course addresses the ill-structured problems and need for computational intelligence
methods. It introduces the concepts of heuristics and their use in conjunction with search methods,
solving problems using heuristics and metaheuristics, constraints satisfaction. The course also
introduces the concepts of cooperation and adaptations and how they are influencing new methods for
solving complex problems. The course starts by illustrating how the concepts of cooperation and
adaptation are manifested in nature and how such models are inspiring new types of solutions methods.


Topics that are covered include: 
- search algorithms, game playing, constraints satisfaction, meta-heuristics,
- evolutionary computing methods, swarm intelligence, ant-colony algorithms, particle swarm methods,
- adaptive and learning algorithms and the use of these algorithms in solving continuous and discrete
problems that arise in engineering application
